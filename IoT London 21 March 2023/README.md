# Navigating the panorama of regulations and security solutions - What you need for IoT?
Following the success of [cetome panorama](https://cetome.com/panorama), it is important to know how to navigate these new regulations.

In this presentation, we explain why IoT regulations are needed to tackle the risks of insecure IoT systems. We propose a way to utilise standards to achieve compliance, and a high-level roadmap for IoT manufacturers.

Due to the complexity of this topic, we propose a list of priorities to help IoT manufacturers secure their products throughout their lifecycle.
