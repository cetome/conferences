# Title: IoT cyber security regulations...
...

- A global perspective
- Unexpected negative outcomes on developing countries
- Our savior or a false prophet?
- The S in IoT that stands for security (yep still missing)

# Abstract
Internet of Things (IoT) systems are known for their lack of cyber security. This creates unacceptable risks on our privacy, our safety and our society. With cyber security regulations now a reality, this issue is resolved. Or is it? This presentation is a call for a global IoT cyber security regulation.

We believe that the current approach to IoT cyber security regulations strengthens the digital divide with requirements applying only to limited countries and economic areas where the mass production and white-labelling of insecure products will be grand-fathered.

What is the effect to unregulated areas, mostly developing countries that follow a rapid path of digitalisation? The concept of Smartness is a good idea: smart cities, smart energy distribution, smart water treatment, smart buildings... Smartness will improve the lives of citizens and the society.
However, investing in secure systems has a cost and manufacturers reflect this in their prices (it usually takes several years to achieve compliance).

In this presentation, we anticipate a bleak future for unregulated countries: they will be overflooded with cheap insecure IoT products: "proven" solutions which cannot be sold in regulated areas, or even refurbished products replaced by "secure versions".
In a global connected world, this reinforces the unacceptable risks that regulations was supposed to address. Worse, it creates more issues to the citizens of these countries and on the society as a whole.

This presentation will present a panorama of IoT cyber security regulations, detail their requirements, elaborate on issues faced by developing countries and initiate the discussion around a worldwide regulation.
