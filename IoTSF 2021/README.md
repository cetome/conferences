# How to get ready for a world of IoT cyber security regulations?

## Abstract
IoT systems keep surprising us with their insecurity. And yet nobody is surprised! How can we still accept the risks they create on other systems, our data, our privacy and our safety? Current solution and self-regulation did not bring the expected results. It is now time to regulate! Several governments and economic areas have chosen this path. But how can we make sure regulation is fit for purpose and enables IoT security?

In this talk, we present a panorama of IoT cyber security regulations across the world. We analyse and identify key elements to design and implement a successful IoT cyber security regulation: for policy makers and for manufacturers. We then present solutions to support the implementation of these new rules and discuss on the necessity of enforcement.
